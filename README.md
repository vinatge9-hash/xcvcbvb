# The Daily Grind - Website Build

This project builds a complete, responsive 5-page website for a cozy, modern coffee shop named The Daily Grind. It includes Home (index.html), Our Story (about.html), Visit Us (contact.html), Cart (cart.html), and Checkout (checkout.html), plus a README with build details.

How to use:
- Open the HTML files in a browser to view the site.
- The pages include Tailwind CSS via CDN and fonts loaded from Google Fonts (Lora for headings, Inter for body).
- All styling is done using Tailwind CSS classes directly in the HTML. No external CSS files or style blocks were used.

Notes:
- The design uses a warm coffee-inspired palette and placeholders for images as described in the brief.
- The current year (2025) is used in the footer and copy.
- Placeholder location used where a business address was required: Nadargul, Telangana, India.
